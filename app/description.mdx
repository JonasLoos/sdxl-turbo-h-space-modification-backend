## How this works

The prompt is formed by the *base prompt* and *prompt continuation* from above and then send to a [SDXL-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo) model. The h-space of the model, which is in the bottom of the unet, is then adjusted during the image generation process. For this adjustment, a precomputed direction is scaled by the given scales from above and added. The direction is computed by running the model multiple times with a base prompt and an adjusted prompt and then taking the average h-space difference between the two.

Here is a simplified excerpt from [model repo](https://github.com/JonasLoos/sdxl-turbo-h-space-modification-model):

```python
pipe = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained('stabilityai/sdxl-turbo', torch_dtype=torch.float16, variant="fp16").to('cuda')

def get_representation(text, count=50):
    reprs = []
    def get_repr(module, input, output): reprs.append(output.detach())
    for i in range(count):
        with torch.no_grad(), pipe.unet.mid_block.register_forward_hook(get_repr):
            pipe(prompt = text, num_inference_steps = 1, guidance_scale=0.0)
    return torch.cat(reprs).mean(axis=0).cpu()

direction = get_representation("a portrait of a smiling person") - get_representation("a portrait of a person")
```
